<!-- covers: package.jido_code.version_controlled_quality_surfaces -->

This repository is historical and unsupported. It does not accept new features,
routine fixes, support requests, or releases. There is no successor project.

Only repository owners can approve retirement, legal, or critical security
changes. Use a branch and pull request for an approved change.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agentjido/jido_code_v1.git
   cd jido_code_v1
   ```

2. Install the repo toolchain:
   ```bash
   asdf install
   ```

3. Install dependencies and build the local browser assets:
   ```bash
   mix setup
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   mix server
   ```

For day-to-day development:

- `mix assets.setup` installs the Vite and LiveVue browser dependencies
- `mix assets.build` builds the current browser bundle and SSR output
- `mix frontend.verify` runs the repo-owned browser pipeline verification plus UI reset guardrails
- `mix ui_reset.verify` runs focused area shell, no-DaisyUI, explicit-registry, and fallback checks
- `mix source_graph.verify` runs the repo-owned semantic source-code graph verification suite
- `mix memory.verify` verifies the ontology pair, typed governed links, and the repo-owned memory recovery path
- `mix semantic.verify` runs the full product-facing semantic graph verification suite
- `mix server` is the preferred local start path and prepares browser deps or builds when the LiveVue/Vite output is missing
- `mix test` runs the test suite
- `mix onboarding.reset --keep-owner` rewinds onboarding to signed-in `/setup` while preserving the bootstrap owner and clearing imported managed repos
- `mix onboarding.reset --full` returns the install to first-run bootstrap and clears local bootstrap users plus imported managed repos
- `tauri/README.md` is only for desktop packaging/runtime work, not the normal contributor path

Product record shape changes are explicit in this workspace. Update the
embedded store codec, ontology, and query projection together before finalizing
the change set.

## Route Orientation

Keep the routed entry contract explicit in product code and tests:

- `/welcome` is the public/bootstrap and sign-in entry route
- `/setup` is the signed-in continuation surface while onboarding is incomplete
- `/dashboard` is the durable ready-state authenticated landing
- `/settings/auth` is the durable home for Provider Login and Git Provider Integrations

## Canonical Repo And Run Terms

New product code, tests, and docs should default to `SourceRepo`,
`ManagedRepo`, and governed `Run` terminology.

- Use shared helpers such as `provision_managed_repo!/1` and
  `create_governed_run!/2` for greenfield test setup.
- Keep `Project` and `WorkflowRun` references limited to explicit
  compatibility, migration, or audit coverage, and label those cases clearly.

## Source Code Graph Capability

The repository-scoped semantic graph stack uses `elixir_ontologies`,
`triple_store`, `sparql`, and `rocksdb`.

- The canonical named graph is `source_code`.
- Repository-local graph data lives under `.jido_code/source_code_graph/triple_store`.
- Normal workflow is explicit: analyze, load or refresh, then query.
- If you touch the semantic graph boundary, actions, pod agents, or repository
  workspace entrypoints, run `mix source_graph.verify`.
- If you touch memory graph boundaries, capture envelopes, memory actions,
  memory workspace entrypoints, workflow provenance capture, or durable-memory
  adoption flows, run `mix memory.verify`.
- If you touch product-facing semantic services, semantic operator UI, semantic
  workflow entrypoints, or governed semantic-finding adoption, run
  `mix semantic.verify`.

Reach for the semantic graph when you need repository-wide semantic structure
such as module discovery, function discovery, impact tracing, runtime-pattern
lookups, or repeated SPARQL-backed questions. Prefer normal file/code tools when
you need exact latest source text, line-level editing context, or trivial
single-file inspection.

Treat the semantic graph as a bounded enhancement rather than a required
product dependency:

- keep semantic freshness, stale state, and recovery visible in operator-facing
  behavior
- let planning, review, and explanation opt into semantic context explicitly
- route semantic findings back into governed records before they change product
  behavior

The memory graph follows the same bounded rule:

- provenance enters through explicit typed envelopes at `AgentWorkspace` and
  product workflow seams
- durable memory enters only after explicit classification or governed adoption
- raw runtime output, prompt text, or agent output is not durable memory unless
  a bounded product path adopts it
- new governed links should use typed `governed_references` directly instead of
  introducing fresh generic artifact-path contracts
- generic artifact-style governed links now count as legacy recovery-only store
  state and should be rebuilt or revalidated instead of extended
- governed product records remain the canonical embedded-store truth; memory and
  provenance graphs store supporting semantic context and navigation only

Use `mix memory.verify` when this stack changes to confirm:

- the companion ontology pair is present
- typed governed links have replaced legacy governed-artifact semantics
- repository-local rebuild or revalidation still recovers older graph state cleanly

## Code Quality

Before submitting a PR, ensure all quality checks pass:

```bash
mix q
```

This runs:
- `mix deps.unlock --check-unused` - Dependency hygiene check
- `mix format --check-formatted` - Code formatting check
- `mix deps.compile` - Dependency compilation sanity check
- `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` - Compilation with strict warnings
- `mix credo --min-priority higher` - Standards-aligned static code analysis

For broader local quality review while the repo carries existing Dialyzer and Doctor debt:

```bash
mix quality
```

This extends `mix q` with:
- `mix frontend.verify` - LiveVue/Vite/SSR pipeline verification plus UI reset guardrails
- `mix doctor --raise` - Documentation coverage check
- `mix dialyzer` - Broader static type analysis

Run `mix source_graph.verify`, `mix memory.verify`, `mix semantic.verify`, or
`mix runtime.verify` when your change touches those product boundaries; they are
kept separate from the fast UI reset loop.

For running tests with coverage:

```bash
mix coveralls
mix coveralls.html
```

The repo-local package-quality baseline is expressed through `mix.exs`, this guide, the top-level `README.md`, and the normal Mix quality gates.

## Frontend Conventions

The routed browser shell stays LiveView-first. The current product shell is the root area button menu plus shared status strip in `<Layouts.app ...>`, backed by `JidoCodeWeb.Areas`. Reach for Vue only when a surface genuinely needs richer client-side composition than HEEx plus lightweight hooks can comfortably support.

- Keep pages, route ownership, area navigation, auth, and server-owned form workflows in LiveView.
- Add a new area by updating `JidoCodeWeb.Areas`, routing/live-action ownership, `JidoCodeWeb.AreaPanels` when the area has a root overview, and route-shell tests.
- Use `JidoCodeWeb.Components.UI` as the application boundary for SaladUI-backed HEEx primitives. If product code needs a new SaladUI primitive, add a wrapper there first.
- Keep generated shadcn-vue primitives under `assets/vue/components/ui/`; use them from Vue islands, not from HEEx.
- Mount Vue islands through `<.vue_surface ...>` rather than raw `<.vue ...>` calls.
- Treat `props:` as server-authored data from LiveView. If a Vue surface needs LiveView streams, pass them through `streams:` so diff behavior stays intact.
- Map Vue emits back into LiveView with `events: %{"emit-name" => "live_view_event"}` or explicit `Phoenix.LiveView.JS` values instead of letting Vue own the workflow.
- Register production-mounted Vue islands explicitly in `assets/vue/index.ts`; do not restore broad `import.meta.glob` auto-registration.
- Use the `JidoCodeWeb.LiveVueCase` helpers only on screens that actually mount Vue. Plain LiveView routes should keep using the normal `Phoenix.LiveViewTest` path.
- Keep degraded frontend behavior product-oriented. If a Vue surface cannot load or SSR is reduced, the page should fall back to bounded LiveView fallback messaging rather than raw Vite, SSR, or manifest errors.
- Do not reintroduce DaisyUI dependencies, DaisyUI component classes, route-local chrome that competes with the area shell, or the old subject-tree shell.
- Run `mix frontend.verify` whenever a change touches `live_vue`, shared browser helpers, Vite config, SSR entrypoints, generated Vue primitives, the explicit island registry, or the root browser dependency surface.
- Run `mix ui_reset.verify` for focused checks when touching the area shell, SaladUI wrappers, shadcn-vue islands, fallback behavior, or UI reset documentation.

## Conversation Conventions

Conversation work in this repo is product work, not a parallel chat lane.

- Keep conversations bound to an explicit `ManagedRepo` and, when durable work is in play, to one canonical `WorkItem`.
- Prefer the event-driven conversation path. Live updates should flow through the product-owned conversation event stream, with snapshots reserved for bootstrap, reconnect recovery, and degraded continuity instead of polling-first UI.
- Treat repo detail as the canonical productive-conversation host. Workbench, governed run detail, and dashboard should only project bounded supervision state and link back rather than introducing page-local transcript or composer ownership.
- Treat `turn.steer`, `turn.stop`, `tool.cancel`, pause, and resume as explicit control-lane commands rather than ad hoc message priorities or browser-local state.
- When a conversation redirects or promotes work, send that demand back through the governed work loop so `WorkItem` auditability stays canonical.
- Keep provider/model readiness, workspace prerequisites, and degraded continuity visible in the route-owned shell instead of burying them in raw runtime metadata.
- Keep short-term shared context bounded and explainable. Referenced files, accepted tool results, and pending clarification state may inform steering, but they should remain visible, product-shaped context rather than hidden memory.
