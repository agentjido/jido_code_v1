Jido.Code was an experimental Phoenix + LiveView application built on an
embedded triple-store control plane and the Jido runtime. It also had a Tauri
desktop packaging path.

The final source is incomplete and has known failing checks. Do not use it for a
new production system. There is no migration target because there is no
successor project.

## Historical Local Use

These commands are for source review and local experiments only. They do not
describe a supported product.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentjido/jido_code_v1.git
cd jido_code_v1

asdf install
mix setup
mix server
```

Then open http://localhost:4100

For local review, leave `DATABASE_URL` unset. `mix setup` installs dependencies
and builds assets. The historical desktop packaging notes are in
[`tauri/README.md`](https://github.com/agentjido/jido_code_v1/blob/main/tauri/README.md).

## What This Repo Contains

The final source contains these areas:

- a Phoenix web app with product-owned sign-in, settings, setup, and dashboard/workbench routes
- a repo-scoped conversation orchestration layer with interruptible turns, durable event history, bounded shared context, and governed work steering
- Forge, an OTP subsystem for isolated execution sessions with observable events
- GitHub integration primitives for repos, webhook deliveries, analyses, and automation-oriented workflows
- Jido-oriented command, skill, and workflow task surfaces for local operator and developer use
- a Tauri desktop packaging path that wraps the Phoenix backend as a sidecar application

Treat this repository as historical source, not as an implementation base or a
finished end-user product.

For new repo work, prefer canonical repository or managed-repository language
and governed-run terms. Keep `Project` and `WorkflowRun` references confined to
explicit compatibility, migration, or audit seams.

## Route Orientation

The routed entry model is intentionally split:

- `/welcome` is the public/bootstrap and sign-in entry route
- `/setup` is the signed-in continuation surface while onboarding is incomplete
- `/dashboard` is the durable ready-state authenticated landing
- `/settings/auth` is the durable home for Provider Login and Git Provider Integrations

## Local Development

The repo toolchain is pinned in `.tool-versions` for `asdf`. Normal day-to-day development should feel like a conventional Phoenix app:

```bash
mix setup
mix assets.setup
mix assets.build
mix frontend.verify
mix ui_reset.verify
mix server
mix test
mix onboarding.reset --keep-owner
mix onboarding.reset --full
```

`.env.example` includes the main runtime overrides. For normal repo-root development, `config/runtime.exs` now auto-loads ignored `.env`, `.env.local`, and `.env.dev.local` files during dev boot so local values like `JIDO_CODE_SECRET_REF_ENCRYPTION_KEY` can be set without exporting them in your shell. Shell env vars still take precedence, and the important rule is still: leave `DATABASE_URL` unset and use the embedded store defaults.

You may also need extra credentials depending on what you are exercising:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude-powered flows
- `SPRITES_API_TOKEN` for live Sprites-backed execution
- mail provider settings such as `RESEND_API_KEY`

Product record shape changes are explicit in this repo. Update the embedded
store codec, ontology, and query projection together so runtime records and
semantic projections stay aligned.

## Source Code Graph

The repo now carries a repository-scoped semantic source-code graph capability
for managed repositories.

- The stack is built from `elixir_ontologies`, `triple_store`, `sparql`, and
  `rocksdb`.
- The graph is repository-local, not a global service. Each workspace keeps its
  store under `.jido_code/source_code_graph/triple_store`.
- Normal lifecycle is explicit: analyze, load or refresh the canonical
  `source_code` named graph, then query it.
- Contributors touching this stack should have the normal native build toolchain
  available for RocksDB-backed dependencies. The repo already pins the Elixir,
  Erlang, Node, Rust, and Zig toolchain through `.tool-versions`.

Use the semantic graph when you need cross-file semantic structure:

- module and function discovery across a repository
- bounded impact tracing
- runtime pattern lookups
- repeated SPARQL-backed structural questions
- explicit planning, review, and explanation flows that opt into bounded
  semantic context
- governed work or evidence adoption from semantic findings after an explicit
  product action

Prefer ordinary file/code tools when you need:

- exact latest source text
- line-level editing context
- one-off single-file reads
- answers that should not depend on the current graph being analyzed or loaded

Keep the semantic graph as a bounded enhancement, not a hidden dependency:

- operator and workflow paths should remain legible when the graph is stale,
  degraded, or unavailable
- recovery stays product-owned and repo-scoped
- semantic findings only influence product behavior after explicit governed
  adoption into records like `Observation`, `Assessment`, `WorkItem`, or
  `Evidence`

## Frontend Stack

`jido_code` has one official browser architecture: a LiveView-owned routed area shell, SaladUI-backed HEEx primitives behind app-owned wrappers, and generated shadcn-vue primitives inside bounded `live_vue` islands.

- Keep route ownership, auth/session boundaries, area navigation, shell status, and straightforward forms in LiveView and HEEx.
- Add or change product areas through `JidoCodeWeb.Areas`, the Phoenix router, and the root `<Layouts.app ...>` shell instead of route-local chrome.
- Use `JidoCodeWeb.Components.UI` for SaladUI HEEx primitives and add new wrappers there before product LiveViews depend on a new primitive.
- Mount Vue-backed regions through `<.vue_surface ...>` rather than raw LiveVue calls so props, streams, and emits stay product-owned.
- Keep generated shadcn-vue primitives under `assets/vue/components/ui/` and register only production-mounted islands explicitly in `assets/vue/index.ts`.
- Treat `props:` and `streams:` as server-authored boundaries and map Vue emits back into LiveView events.
- Do not reintroduce DaisyUI dependencies, DaisyUI component classes, broad Vue auto-registration, or the old subject-tree shell.
- When changing the browser stack, run `mix frontend.verify`; for focused reset guardrails, run `mix ui_reset.verify`. Hybrid screens must degrade to product-oriented fallback messaging instead of exposing raw Vite or SSR failures to operators.

## Conversation Model

Productive coding conversations are managed-repository scoped and usually attach to one canonical `WorkItem`.

- Use the conversation driver and sequenced event stream for conversation UX. Snapshots are for cold load, reconnect recovery, and degraded continuity, not steady-state polling.
- Treat repo detail as the canonical conversation host surface. Workbench, run detail, and dashboard should project bounded conversation supervision and route operators back into repo detail or governed work paths instead of growing their own transcript or composer state.
- Route steering through canonical work records. If a conversation narrows, redirects, or promotes work, the durable outcome should rejoin `ManagedRepo` and `WorkItem` surfaces instead of living as free-floating chat state.
- Keep runtime readiness operator-readable. Selected provider/model, workspace prerequisites, and degraded continuity should stay visible on the route-owned conversation shell while raw sequence metadata remains secondary.
- Keep short-term collaboration context bounded and explainable. Referenced files, accepted tool results, and pending clarification state should remain explicit enough to steer follow-up work without turning conversations into hidden long-term memory.

## Day-To-Day Commands

```bash

mix assets.setup        # install browser toolchain dependencies
mix assets.build        # build the Vite + SSR browser bundle
mix frontend.verify     # run browser pipeline verification plus UI reset guardrails
mix ui_reset.verify     # run focused area shell, no-DaisyUI, explicit-registry, and fallback checks
mix runtime.verify      # verify repository runtime, pod lifecycle, snapshots, and AgentWorkspace routing
mix source_graph.verify # run the repo-owned semantic graph verification suite
mix memory.verify       # verify the ontology pair, typed governed links, and repo-owned memory recovery path
mix semantic.verify     # run the full product-facing semantic graph verification suite
mix server              # preferred local start path; prepares browser deps/builds if needed
mix onboarding.reset --keep-owner # keep the bootstrap owner, clear managed repos, and rewind to signed-in /setup
mix onboarding.reset --full       # clear bootstrap users plus managed repos and return to first-run bootstrap
mix test                # run tests
mix q                   # fast merge-safe quality gate
mix quality             # fast gate plus frontend verification, doctor, and dialyzer debt surfacing

```

Repo-owned CLI surfaces stay Mix-first:

```bash
mix skill.list
mix skill.run my-skill --route my/route --data '{"key":"value"}'

mix command list
mix command my-command --params '{"key":"value"}'

mix workflow.control definitions
mix workflow.run my_workflow --inputs '{"file_path":"lib/example.ex","mode":"full"}'
```

## Semantic Memory

The repository semantic stack is now three linked named graphs in one
repository-local store:

- `source_code` for repository structure and semantic code entities
- `workflow_provenance` for bounded work sessions, agent runs, tool use, plans,
  patches, and reviews
- `memory` for durable adopted facts, decisions, conventions, issues, lessons,
  and patterns

The write seam is explicit:

- workflow provenance is inserted at `AgentWorkspace` and product workflow
  boundaries through typed capture envelopes
- durable memory is inserted only after explicit classification or governed
  adoption
- raw runtime or model output is not durable memory on its own

The verification and cutover seam is explicit too:

- `mix memory.verify` checks the companion ontology pair, typed governed-link
  adoption, repository-local graph coherence, and bounded rebuild or
  revalidation behavior
- new memory and provenance code should emit typed `governed_references`
  directly; generic artifact-style governed links are legacy recovery-only
  state, not the contract for new work
- governed truth still lives in embedded product records such as
  `ManagedRepo`, `WorkItem`, `Run`, `Evidence`, and governed `Decision`; the
  semantic graphs store supporting recall, provenance, and cross-links

When touching the memory graph boundary, capture envelopes, memory actions,
memory workspace entrypoints, or provenance or durable-memory adoption flows,
run `mix memory.verify`.

deployment of the memory graph capability, see the
